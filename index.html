   <h1>Parker Scott Eldredge</h1>

   <p>I'm a photography major from Pleasant Grove, Utah. I'm happily married to the most beautiful girl i've ever set eyes on. We have the cutest cat named Pepper. I have about two years left at BYU before I hopefully get accepted to grad school where I will work on my Masters in Fine Arts.</p>
